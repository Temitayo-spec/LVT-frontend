- contributors branch
Every contributor has the right to a branch. Contributors work individually on their personal branch and merge into the dev branch if they are done with a task(You must have perfected the task at hand before merging to the dev branch)

-Dev branch
To ensure the master branch is as clean as possible, contributors work with the dev branch. Each contributor merges their code into the dev branch and NEVER into the master branch. 

-Master branch
Only approved contributors can rebase branches with the master. 
code from the dev branch will be rebased to the master branch.

Approved contributors
1. Kamal O. Adebayo


-Other branches
In the future, other branches for bug fixing, legal issues... might be created. They should follow the same path as the dev branch.
