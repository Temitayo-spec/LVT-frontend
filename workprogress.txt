From the first sign up page(signup_0), by selecting student, user will be directed to "student_signup_0.html". That page has corresponding files in the css and js folders. User will progress to a form for students(student_signup_0.html).

Every page above has corresponding files in the css and js folders.

If the user chooses to be an educator, it will follow the same process.
